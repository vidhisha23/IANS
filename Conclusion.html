                        - In Mono-Alphabetic Cipher , Cipher Text alphabet for each Plain Text alphabet is fixed throughout process .
                         This preservation of alphabet makes it vulnerable to frequency based attacks.

                        <br>
                        - There are 26! possible permutation of key and thus an Attacker can decode the Cipher text based on those 26! possible permutation
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        - Note that the frequency of occurrence of characters in the plaintext is "preserved" in the ciphertext. 
                        For instance, the most frequent character in the ciphertext is likely to be the encryption of the plaintext character "e" which is the most frequently occurring character in English.
